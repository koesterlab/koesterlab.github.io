<p>
The <a href="https://snakemake.github.io">Snakemake</a> workflow management system is a tool to create <b>reproducible</b> and <b>scalable</b> data analyses.
Workflows are described via a <b>human readable</b>, Python based language.
They can be <b>seamlessly scaled</b> to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition.
<a href="https://snakemake.github.io">Snakemake</a> workflows can entail a description of required <b>software</b>, which will be <b>automatically deployed</b> to any execution environment.
Snakemake can be used to automatically generate rich interactive visual reports that contain results together data provenance information.
These reports can be easily shared with collaborators (e.g. via email) and only require a web browser for viewing.
</p>
<p>
With over <b>1 million downloads</b> and on average <b>more than 14 new citations per week</b> in 2024, <a href="https://snakemake.github.io">Snakemake</a> is a widely used and accepted <b>standard for reproducible data science</b> that has powered numerous high impact publications.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://datavzrd.github.io">Datavzrd</a> tool is a recently published tool to <b>rapidly create interactive visual reports</b> from tabular results.
The reports are designed to be <b>easily shareable with collaborators</b> (via email and cloud), can be viewed in any web browser, and can be used in combination with Snakemake reports for rich and transparent manuscript supplements.
Via simple textual configuration, Datavzrd enables a <b>plethora of column and table visualizations and interactivity features</b> (heatmaps, tick plots, histograms, link-outs, detail-views, etc.).
</p>
<p>
  The tutorial will introduce Snakemake on the first day, and teach Datavzrd, also in combination with Snakemake, on the second day.
</p>

<h2>Program</h2>
 <p>
  <b>Lunch breaks</b> are planned for <b>noon to 1pm</b>. Coffee breaks will be scheduled flexibly during the course, as most parts are self-paced.
